# Mile1: CORE JAVA PROJECT: STUDENT GRADE CALCULATION   
 
## Project Design: 
You need to implement a Student grade calculation system in Java. Here, data is available in an array of objects.  
If the given object has any data errors, then, the program has to return appropriate error messages. On the other hand, if given object has no validation errors, then, we need to find the grade and print the same.  

## Packages Used: 
Package 1:   com.mile1.bean– All bean classes are defined.  
Package 2:    com.mile1.exception –All the used defined exceptions are defined.  
Package 3:  com.mile1.service–All functional classes are defined.  
Package 4:    com.mile1.main -- A class with main function is defined.
